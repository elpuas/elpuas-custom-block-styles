# Custom Block Styles Plugin

This plugin is based on the article [“You Might Not Need a Custom Block: The Block Styles API”](https://elpuas.com/blog/you-might-not-need-a-custom-block-the-block-styles-api/) and is designed to extend the functionality of the WordPress block editor by adding custom block styles.

## Description

The Custom Block Styles Plugin allows you to easily add new styles to existing blocks in the WordPress block editor. Specifically, this plugin includes:

- Custom Button Styles: Adds styles like a Primary Button with an icon and hover effect, as well as a Secondary Button.
- Custom Heading Styles: Introduces Gradient and Glowing header styles to make your headings stand out.

These styles are registered using server-side functions in PHP, making them easily accessible and ready to use within the block editor.

2. Upload the plugin to your WordPress site via the plugin uploader, or manually place the files in the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
